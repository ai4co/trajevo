The predict_trajectory function takes as input the current trajectory (8 frames) and generates 20 possible future trajectories for the next 12 frames. It has only one parameter: the past trajectory array.
The output is a numpy array of shape [20, num_agents, 12, 2] containing all 20 trajectories.
Note that we are interesting in obtaining at least one good trajectory, not necessarily 20.
Thus, diversifying a little bit is good.
Note that the heuristic should be generalizable to new distributions.

The primary optimization goal for the generated function is to minimize the **Mean SquaredError (MSE)** between one of the 20 predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectory. During the evolutionary process, functions will be selected and improved based on their MSE score.
However, the final performance of the best function will also be evaluated using **Average Displacement Error (ADE)** and **Final Displacement Error (FDE)** for a comprehensive assessment against standard benchmarks.
